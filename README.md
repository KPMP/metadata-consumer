# metadata-consumer
Repository to hold the Pentaho scripts used for both validation of the metadata files as well as the scripts to consume the metadata for use in the system.

This repository will store the xml that defines the scripts used by Pentaho to perform the data transformations.

You can download a free version of Pentaho from https://sourceforge.net/projects/pentaho/ to use for editing the scripts.
